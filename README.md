The topic selected by our Project team 8 is surrounding fraudulent e-commerce transactions
With two data sets merged, we filtered out the legitimate transactions to analyze the fraud transactions among a vast variety of categories: Age, transaction amount, payment method etc.

We have provided 8 visualizations which include:

Number of customers by product category and age group

Fraud Transactions vs Account Age Days
Tree map for hour of day the fraud transactions took place
line plot for the days age of the account that had the fraud take place
bar chart of the hour of day fraud took place over the 24 hour daily window
Pie chart of method of payments used for fraud
box plots for fraud and non fraud transactions
bar chart for number of customers by product category and age group
2 line plots outlining payment methods used in fraud transactions

Please note that our notebook includes other various visuals we considered in our analysis which did not make the final presentation
